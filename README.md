### Hi there! :wave:
My name is Hamidreza Delshad, a passionate junior full stack developer and a freelance graphic designer from Sweden. My passion for software is coming up with concepts and turning them into beautiful interfaces. When I develop something, I pay close attention to the user experience, architecture, and code quality.

- :sunglasses: I'm learning new things about backend to become a full stack developer at [Integrify Academy](https://integrify.academy/international).
- :mag_right: I'm looking for a job position as a frontend/ full stack developer.
